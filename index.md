Five months ago, 25 people in REA Group set out with a mission: to deliver a free workshop for women who want to know more about AWS and DevOps. The first DevOps Girls was held for 60 women in Richmond, Victoria - it was a resounding success.
All it took was an open Github Repo, 44 dollars in AWS credit, and a lot of love for the community.
